# Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for predicting customer churn rates using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Overview

Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses aiming to retain their customer base and maximize revenue. By analyzing historical data and identifying patterns in customer behavior, we can develop predictive models to anticipate churn and take proactive measures to mitigate it.

## Key Features

- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks.
- Utilization of deep learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks and deep neural networks, for more complex pattern recognition.
- Robust data preprocessing and feature engineering to extract meaningful insights from raw data.
- Extensive data visualization to understand customer behavior and identify potential churn predictors.
- Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
- Comprehensive documentation explaining the methodology, code structure, and usage instructions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to understand the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation process.
